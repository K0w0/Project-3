            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>"Phantom Blood" is the first part of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, created by Hirohiko Araki. Set in late 19th-century England, the story follows Jonathan Joestar, a noble and kind-hearted young man who becomes embroiled in a supernatural conflict after his adoptive brother, Dio Brando, sets into motion a plan to gain power by any means necessary.</p>
            <p>Dio, born into poverty and bitterness, is adopted by the wealthy Joestar family after his father's death. Despite outward appearances, Dio harbors resentment and ambition, seeking to usurp Jonathan and claim the Joestar fortune. Tensions escalate until Dio discovers an ancient Stone Mask that grants vampiric powers when activated with blood. Using it, Dio becomes an immortal vampire with overwhelming strength and dark abilities.</p>
            <p>To stop Dio’s reign of terror, Jonathan trains under Will A. Zeppeli, a mysterious man who teaches him Hamon (or Ripple), a martial art that uses controlled breathing to generate energy akin to sunlight—perfect for fighting vampires. With the help of Zeppeli and the brash but loyal Robert E.O. Speedwagon, Jonathan embarks on a dangerous quest to defeat Dio and rid the world of the evil he has unleashed.</p>
            <p>The battle between Jonathan and Dio culminates in a tragic and heroic finale aboard a ship, where Jonathan sacrifices himself to ensure Dio’s defeat. However, Dio manages to survive, setting the stage for future parts of the Joestar saga. Phantom Blood blends gothic horror, martial arts, and melodrama to establish the foundational themes of legacy, courage, and the eternal struggle between good and evil that define the JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure series.</p>

            <p>Set in the 1930s, the story follows Joseph Joestar, Jonathan’s grandson, a rebellious but clever young man living in New York. Joseph discovers the resurgence of the Stone Mask’s dark legacy through mysterious superhuman beings called the Pillar Men.</p>
            <p>Joseph travels to Europe to stop the awakened Pillar Men—ancient beings seeking the Super Aja, a stone that can grant them godlike power. Alongside allies like Caesar Zeppeli and Lisa Lisa, Joseph masters Hamon and uses his cunning to survive increasingly deadly confrontations.</p>
            <p>After a climactic battle with Kars, the ultimate being, Joseph defeats him by launching him into space, trapping him forever. Thought to be dead, Joseph surprises everyone by surviving and later marries Suzie Q. The world is safe again—for now.</p>

            <p>In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high schooler and Joseph Joestar’s grandson, discovers he has a supernatural power called a Stand. He learns that Dio, now inhabiting Jonathan’s body, has returned, causing Stand awakenings in the Joestar bloodline.</p>
            <p>Jotaro, Joseph, and a team of Stand users—Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, and later Iggy—travel from Japan to Egypt to kill Dio and save Jotaro’s mother, whose life is endangered by her uncontrolled Stand. They battle Dio’s Stand-wielding assassins along the way.</p>
            <p>The group reaches Dio’s mansion and engages in a brutal final battle. After heavy losses, Jotaro defeats Dio using Star Platinum to stop time, destroying him permanently. The Joestar bloodline is saved, and peace returns, but not without great sacrifice.</p>
